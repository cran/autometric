Package: autometric
Title: Background Resource Logging
Description: Intense parallel workloads can be difficult to monitor.
  Packages 'crew.cluster', 'clustermq', and 'future.batchtools'
  distribute hundreds of worker processes over multiple computers.
  If a worker process exhausts its available memory,
  it may terminate silently, leaving the underlying problem difficult
  to detect or troubleshoot.
  Using the 'autometric' package, a worker can proactively monitor
  itself in a detached background thread.
  The worker process itself runs normally,
  and the thread writes to a log every few seconds.
  If the worker terminates unexpectedly, 'autometric' can read and
  visualize the log file to reveal potential resource-related
  reasons for the crash. The 'autometric' package borrows heavily from
  the methods of packages 'ps' <doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.ps> and 'psutil'.
